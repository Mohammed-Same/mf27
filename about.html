             <p class="terms-1"> Molecule Fitness Centre offers fitness-training facility. Idea came in mind to start a fitness center seeing the hospitals being houseful as cinema theatre and malls during festivals. We do things differently, Primary objective is to keep individual healthy every day. Trainer listen to the need of client and design plan tailored to suit you whilst utilizing holistic methods. We are concerned about public health thereby try to keep environment as clean as first day. Indian community is unware of many diseases breaking out in coming years. As we, all know in life you will never escape from a gym and doctor. Todayâ€™s nutritional mixtures made physical activity mandatory. Chicken is contaminated, Milk is coming from powder, and Vegetables have pesticides and arsenic. Majority of public have no access to organic food. Worst thing you can do your life is depend on processed packed food materials. Food is turning poisonous each year passing. We never endorse negative substance. Weare patronized by providing training services and educate healthy eating lifestyle.Fitness is a marathon not a sprint. Patience is the key.
